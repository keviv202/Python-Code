'''Assignment 2
Please add your code where indicated. You may conduct a superficial test of
your code by executing this file in a python interpreter.
The documentation strings ("docstrings") for each function tells you what the
function should accomplish. If docstrings are unfamiliar to you, consult the
Python Tutorial section on "Documentation Strings".
